	<p> I am a senior attending Metro Tech High School! I will be attending either Polytechnic or YearUp for Computer Science or Cyber Security. I like public speaking on the competetive level.
	<p> I am in FBLA and Skills USA which allow me to do the things I love such as computers and public speaking. I was in Student Goverment for about five years and I loved every minute of it. I travled all around Arizona for StuGo events and saw snow for the first time because of them.
	<p> I am actively invloved in the community and love helping others. I have travled to Europe and saw historic buldings. I love seeing and learning new things.   </p>
